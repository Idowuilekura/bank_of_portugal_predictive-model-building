# bank_of_portugal_predictive-model-building
The aim of this project is to build accurate financial predictive model for bank of Portugal, The investment and portfolio department would want to be able to identify their customers who potentially would subscribe to their term deposits. As there has been heightened interest of marketing managers to carefully tune their directed campaigns to the rigorous selection of contacts, the goal of your employer is to find a model that can predict which future clients who would subscribe to their term deposit. Having such an effective predictive model can help increase their campaign efficiency as they would be able to identify customers who would subscribe to their term deposit and thereby direct their marketing efforts to them. This would help them better manage their resources (e.g human effort, phone calls, time).It will be a waste of time for the marketing teams to speand a lot of resources on potential customers who will not subscribe, to achive this the Bank of Portugal,collected a huge amount of data that includes customers profiles of those who have to subscribe to term deposits and the ones who did not subscribe to a term deposit. As their newly employed machine learning researcher, they want you to come up with a robust predictive model that would help them identify customers who would or would not subscribe to their term deposit in the future.
The main goal of this project is to is to carry out data exploration, data cleaning, feature extraction, and developing robust machine learning algorithms that would aid them in the departmentand and also balancing any imbalanced dataset. 

## Data.py
Contains codes that was used for data cleaning,feature extraction, encoding the categorical columns, scaling the numeric columns values to lie between -1 and 0, reducing the dimensions of the columns with principal components analysis or any of auto encoders and t-stochaistic neighbors 
## model.py
Contains all codes that was used to run cross validation with k-fold and stratified kfold cross validation, pick the best 3 model based on any evaluation metrics that is given and make predictions
## main.py
Contains codes that was imported from data.py and model.py and automates everything
